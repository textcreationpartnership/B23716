            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Medicine is not apropriated to any particular Distemper, but it's office is to retard that Natural decay, which old age brings upon Humane Bodies, and therefore may reasonably be suppos'd to be a good shield against most, if not all Diseases: Therefore I will not pretend that I have Known it Cure any Distemper, excepting one, and such a one as I believe, never was Help'd by any Medicine but This, that is to say, <hi>Impotency in Love affairs,</hi> both in <hi>Old Men,</hi> and <hi>Women;</hi> This I suppose, many will laugh at, but few will believe, for I could not give any credit to it my self, (though I received it from very good hands) till by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I found Infallible: it has that Miraculous Operation that it renders <hi>Old Men,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> of three or four score, as Youthful, in this point, as those of twenty or thirty years of Age; and not by a suddain provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat but by a supply of <hi>Vital-Spirits,</hi> and gradually reducing the Body to such a measure of Strength and Health, as naturally produces this Admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Effect: by this means it extreamly improves the performances of the <hi>Young,</hi> and takes away the cause of <hi>Sterility</hi> in both Sexes, which is want of <hi>Spirits,</hi> thus far I know it's Virtue by Experience on several Persons, and from hence conclude (as I think any body that understands reason must) that it is an Extraordinary prolonger of Life.</p>
